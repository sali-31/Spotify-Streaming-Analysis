# 🎵 Spotify Streaming Analysis

## 📌 What the Project Does

This project analyzes a large dataset of Spotify tracks to explore the relationships between audio features (like energy, danceability, acousticness, and valence) and popularity, genre, and explicit content. It uses Python and libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to perform:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Correlation analysis and heatmaps  
- K-Means clustering of song types  
- Linear regression to uncover audio relationships  
- Statistical testing for deeper insights

## 💡 Why the Project Is Useful

With millions of songs on streaming platforms, understanding what makes music popular or distinctive is valuable for:

- Music analysts and data scientists studying trends
- Artists and producers looking to optimize track characteristics
- Developers building recommendation engines or playlist tools
- Anyone interested in how audio traits relate to listener behavior
